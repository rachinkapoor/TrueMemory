"""Regression locks for issue #422 — backlog drain must not unlink the
``.processing`` claim on spawn.

Pre-fix bug: ``_drain_backlog`` (and the cascade / MCP drainers) removed the
``.processing`` claim marker immediately after ``Popen`` returned — i.e. when
the ingest worker was *spawned*, not when it *succeeded*. A worker that exits
non-zero (crash, OOM, embed-model error) therefore left no claim behind, so the
stale-``.processing`` watcher (``cleanup_stale_processing``) had nothing to
recover and the session's memories were silently dropped.

Post-fix contract:
  1. The drainer leaves the ``.processing`` claim in place after spawning.
  2. The ingest CLI deletes the claim on confirmed success
     (``clear_backlog_processing``).
  3. A dead worker (non-zero exit) leaves the claim, and
     ``cleanup_stale_processing`` restores it to ``.json`` so the session is
     re-queued rather than dropped.
