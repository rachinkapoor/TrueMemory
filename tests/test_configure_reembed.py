"""Regression lock for Hunter F03 — `truememory_configure` re-embed flow.

Prior behavior:
1. After a tier change, the re-embed block called ``build_vectors`` but NOT
   ``build_separation_vectors`` — the separation table was re-created empty,
   silently breaking separation search after any tier switch.
2. The whole block was wrapped in ``except Exception: pass`` — OOM,
   disk-full, interrupted download left the DB in an indeterminate state
   and the response still claimed success.
3. ``_memory = None`` happened outside a ``finally`` so failures left the
   stale Memory instance cached.

This test file verifies the fix: both vec tables rebuilt, exceptions
surfaced in ``rebuild_error``, ``_memory`` always nulled.
