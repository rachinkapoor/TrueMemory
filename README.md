## 🔬 Benchmark

Tested on [LoCoMo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo), the standard benchmark for conversational memory. 1,540 questions across 10 conversations. All 8 systems share the same answer model, judge, scoring, top-k, and byte-identical answer prompt — only retrieval differs.

> **Note on charts:** the hero banner and the three charts below still show the v0.3.0 single-Pro-tier layout (91.5%). Chart regeneration is tracked for a later release; all numerical claims in the README text and tables reflect the v0.4.0 three-tier scores (90.1 / 91.5 / 91.8%).

</p>

TrueMemory achieves **state-of-the-art accuracy for fully-local memory systems** at zero ongoing infrastructure cost. Edge and Base run entirely offline with no API keys. Pro adds one small LLM call per query for HyDE query expansion.

</p>

All scores use the same evaluation pipeline: GPT-4.1-mini answer generation, GPT-4o-mini judge (3x majority vote), temperature=0. Zero errors across 12,320 total answers. Scores use a lenient semantic-match judge; rankings are valid across all systems but absolute values are higher than published LoCoMo baselines using strict exact-match.

## ⚡ Research Highlights

- **30+ percentage points more accurate than Mem0** on LoCoMo (91.8% Pro vs 61.4%)
- **2x more cost-efficient** per correct answer than Mem0
- **Runs offline** on any device with Python 3.10+ and 512MB RAM (Edge tier)
- **One SQLite file, zero API keys** for Edge and Base tiers. The entire 6-layer system runs offline.
- **Within 2.7pp of EverMemOS**, the only higher-scoring system — and EverMemOS uses pre-computed retrieval rather than live search at query time.

<p align="center">

</p>

TrueMemory Pro nearly matches EverMemOS across all 4 question categories. Mem0 collapses on multi-hop reasoning (37.7% vs 90.7%).

## 🏗️ Edge / Base / Pro

Same features, same 6-layer pipeline. Three tiers trade off install size, hardware, and LoCoMo accuracy. All three use the same retrieval architecture (FTS5 + dense + RRF + cross-encoder reranker); the differences are the embedder, the reranker, and whether HyDE query expansion is used. Base and Pro share an embedder and reranker — only HyDE differs.

| | Edge | Base | Pro |
|---|------|------|-----|
| **LoCoMo** | 90.1% | 91.5% | 91.8% |
| **Embedder** | Model2Vec potion-base-8M (8M params, 256d) | Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B @ 256d Matryoshka (600M params) | Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B @ 256d Matryoshka (600M params) |
| **Reranker** | ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 (22M) | gte-reranker-modernbert-base (149M) | gte-reranker-modernbert-base (149M) |
| **HyDE** | off | off | on (requires an LLM API key) |
| **Runs on** | Any machine, CPU only | 4GB+ RAM, CPU or GPU | 4GB+ RAM, CPU or GPU + LLM API key |
| **First install** | ~30MB | ~1.5GB one-time download | ~1.5GB one-time download |
| **Speed** | Ultra-fast | Fast | Fast + 1 LLM call/query |

**Edge** works everywhere. **Base** is the strongest fully-offline tier. **Pro** adds HyDE for the highest LoCoMo score.

### Encoding Gate

Before storing a fact, the ingestion pipeline passes it through an encoding gate — a three-signal filter inspired by hippocampal novelty detection. Each candidate fact is scored by:

1. **Compression novelty** (AUC 0.788) — gzip-based information gain against existing memories
2. **Speech-act salience** (AUC 0.733) — rule-based scorer for short messages + L3's learned salience for longer text
3. **Embedding pair-diff PE** (AUC 0.730) — detects when a message says something *different* about the same topic

The weighted sum (default: `0.25·novelty + 0.20·salience + 0.30·PE`, normalized) must exceed a threshold (default: 0.30) to be stored. A salience floor (default: 0.10) rejects pure noise regardless of novelty. Per-category overrides lower the bar for corrections and decisions. Gate AUC: 0.810. Tune via `TRUEMEMORY_GATE_*` environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

One command. Works on any Mac or Linux box, **even if your system Python is old or missing entirely.**

**Step 1.** Open Terminal:
- **Mac:** press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, press `Enter`
- **Linux:** press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (or open your distro's terminal app)

**Step 2.** Paste this one line and press `Enter`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Step 3.** Wait ~1-2 minutes while it downloads and installs. You'll see progress messages scroll by — that's normal.

**Step 4.** If Claude Desktop was already open, **quit it with `Cmd+Q` and reopen it** (a new chat window is not enough — the config is only read at launch). Then start a new Claude session and TrueMemory walks you through choosing **Edge**, **Base**, or **Pro** on first run.

> **What this actually does:** installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Astral's Python tool manager) if needed, fetches a managed Python 3.12 into `~/.local/share/uv/`, installs TrueMemory into an isolated tool environment, and auto-configures Claude Code and Claude Desktop. **Your system Python is never touched.** No sudo, no venvs, no pip struggle. Uninstall cleanly with `uv tool uninstall truememory`.

> **Want to audit the script first?** It's ~170 lines of shell, no sudo, stays entirely under `$HOME`. Read the source at [`install.sh`](https://github.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/blob/main/install.sh), or download and inspect locally: `curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/main/install.sh -o install.sh && less install.sh && sh install.sh`.

> **Want Base or Pro (adds Qwen3 embeddings + gte-reranker + sentence-transformers, ~1.5-2.5GB depending on OS)?**
> ```bash
> curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/main/install.sh | TRUEMEMORY_EXTRAS="gpu" sh
> ```
> The default install is **Edge** (~30MB, the CPU-only tier). If you pick Base or Pro during first-run setup, TrueMemory will prompt you to install the extra models. Pro additionally requires an LLM API key at runtime for HyDE.
> *(Linux CPU-only boxes will pull PyTorch's default CUDA wheel, which is larger — ~2.5GB total. Mac installs are closer to ~1.5GB.)*

### Python library (for developers)

If you're embedding TrueMemory in your own Python project (requires Python 3.10+):

```bash
pip install truememory
```

```python
from truememory import Memory

m = Memory()
m.add("Prefers dark mode and TypeScript", user_id="alex")
m.add("Allergic to peanuts", user_id="alex")

results = m.search("What are Alex's preferences?", user_id="alex")
print(results[0]["content"])
# → "Prefers dark mode and TypeScript"
```

The database is created automatically at `~/.truememory/memories.db`.

## 🤖 What happens on first run?

Claude forgets you between sessions. TrueMemory fixes that.

The installer (`install.sh`) wires up four lifecycle hooks (SessionStart, Stop, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact) and merges instructions into your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. On your **first session** after installing, the SessionStart hook injects an ASCII banner and guided setup:

1. **Welcome banner** — confirms TrueMemory is installed
2. **Tier selection** — Edge, Base, or Pro (Claude walks you through it)
3. **API key** (Pro only) — required for HyDE query expansion via Anthropic, OpenRouter, or OpenAI
4. **Example prompts** — try "Remember that I prefer dark mode" then verify in a new session

On **subsequent sessions**, the SessionStart hook searches TrueMemory and injects up to 25 relevant memories as context so Claude knows who you are from the start. The Stop hook processes the conversation transcript in the background to extract and store new facts.

### Manual setup

If auto-setup doesn't detect your Claude installation, you can configure manually.

**Claude Code** (if you used the installer above):
```bash
claude mcp add truememory -- truememory-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop:** add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings > Developer > Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "truememory": {
      "command": "/Users/YOU/.local/bin/truememory-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> Use the **absolute path** to `truememory-mcp` — run `which truememory-mcp` to find it. Claude Desktop (and most non-Claude-Code MCP clients) don't inherit your shell's PATH, so relative commands will silently fail.

**No-install alternative (uvx):** skip installing TrueMemory entirely and let Claude run it ephemerally. Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to be installed.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "truememory": {
      "command": "/Users/YOU/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.12", "--from", "truememory", "truememory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

uvx creates a cached environment on first run; subsequent spawns are fast. Good if you want TrueMemory to always be latest-on-PyPI without managing an install.
