"""
Ingestion Pipeline — The "Sleep Consolidation" Analog
=====================================================

The full pipeline runs AFTER conversations end (cold path), not during
(hot path). This mirrors the brain's consolidation process during sleep:

1. Parse transcript into messages (perception)
2. Extract atomic facts via LLM (deep encoding)
3. Pass each fact through encoding gate (hippocampal filtering)
4. Deduplicate against existing memories (consolidation)
5. Store surviving facts (long-term potentiation)
6. Log the full encoding trace (introspection)

The hot path (during conversation) is handled by hooks — deterministic,
zero-overhead capture. The cold path here is where the deep processing
happens.

Design: Complementary Learning Systems (McClelland et al., 1995)
- Fast capture (hooks/hot path) → hippocampal-like rapid encoding
- Slow consolidation (this pipeline) → neocortical-like pattern extraction

    """Serialize dedup-then-store across concurrent ingest processes.

    Two overlapping Stop hooks can race: process A searches for duplicates
    of fact X (none found), then spends 5s on an LLM extraction call. While
    A is waiting, process B writes a semantically identical fact Y. A
    finishes, finds no dup (it already searched), and writes a duplicate.
    SQLite's ``busy_timeout`` alone can't prevent this — it only serializes
    single writes, not the read-then-write sequence above.

    Holding this process-wide lock around the check_duplicate + store_fact
    pair makes the sequence atomic across concurrent hooks. On Windows
    (no fcntl) we skip locking and rely on ``busy_timeout`` + the embedding
    similarity check as best-effort protection.

    Locking discipline (#649, M-31). ``flock`` is the authority on
    mutual exclusion, NOT the PID/mtime bookkeeping:

    - We never unlink a path that may still be flocked by a live holder.
      A dead holder's flock is already released by the kernel, so our
      blocking ``flock(LOCK_EX)`` simply succeeds — no manual TTL steal is
      needed, and a TTL-driven unlink of a live holder's path (the old bug)
      would split the lock across two inodes and give two simultaneous
      holders.
    - After acquiring the flock we verify the path still resolves to the
      same inode as our open fd. If a previous holder unlinked/replaced the
      path while we waited, we are holding a stale inode; we drop it and
      retry against the live path.
    - The PID is written purely for diagnostics (and to let an operator see
      who holds it). mtime is refreshed on acquire as a heartbeat.
