"""
Encoding Gate (Inspired by Hippocampal Novelty Detection)
==========================================================

A memory filter that decides which candidate facts get stored. Three
signals — novelty, salience, and prediction error — are computed and
combined into a weighted score; facts above the threshold are encoded.

**Honest framing**: This module is *inspired by* neuroscience, not a
faithful computational model of it. The three-signal gating architecture
mirrors the *function* of hippocampal / amygdala / prefrontal circuits,
not their *mechanism*. What you see in this code is a pragmatic proxy:

- **Novelty** is vector-similarity inversion via truememory's hybrid
  search. A novel fact is one whose content is dissimilar to existing
  memories. Real CA1 novelty detection involves CA3→CA1 pattern
  completion, oscillatory dynamics, and sparse coding we don't model.

- **Salience** delegates to truememory's existing
  `salience.compute_message_salience` (which scores length, numbers,
  dates, emotional markers, life events) and adds a category weight
  from the LLM extractor's classification. Real amygdala modulation is
  norepinephrine release affecting LTP threshold, not a weighted sum.

- **Prediction error** delegates to truememory's existing
  `predictive.compute_surprise_score` which computes an information-
  theoretic surprise signal by comparing extracted facts against prior
  context. Real predictive coding is Bayesian error propagation up a
  hierarchical generative model.

The delegation to `truememory.salience` and `truememory.predictive` is
intentional: those modules already implement the surprise and salience
scoring that truememory uses for retrieval weighting. Reusing them
keeps the encoding gate consistent with the retrieval layer and avoids
code duplication. If either module is unavailable (older truememory
or partial install) a warning is logged at import time and the gate
falls back to internal heuristics.

**What a skeptical reader should know**: the final encoding decision is
`0.40 * novelty + 0.35 * salience + 0.25 * prediction_error > 0.30`.
The neuroscience names describe what each term is *inspired by*, not a
claim that this is how the brain works.
